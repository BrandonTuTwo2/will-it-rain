# will-it-rain
**Creator:** Brandon Tu

**Description:** A web application/website that displays when it will rain in the next 7 days by converting an inputted address to a latitude and longitude (via nominatim) and getting a forcast from 7timer in JSON format and displaying that information to the user


**Credit:** This app uses...
The nominatim API (found here: https://nominatim.org/) and
The 7Timer API (found here: http://www.7timer.info/) and
The modal code/popup is based on the code found on the W3school code (found here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)

**Usage:** you can find the app running hosted on heroku here: https://will-it-rain.herokuapp.com/

**Additional Note:** this app was made mainly for my parents who can't be bothered to check if its going to rain themselves and asking me to do it instead :')
